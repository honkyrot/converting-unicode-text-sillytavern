This file converts characters<br>
U+201C, U+201D, U+2026, U+2019<br>
into a more basic? unicode character.<br>
i never really liked those characters.

Of course you can use regex or some sort of string substitution to change output either way.

This was originaly for use in SillyTavern, but go have at it.
